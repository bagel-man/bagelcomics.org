    ["Once upon a time, a stupid idiot asked a robot to tell them a story, and they died a miserable death.", "Once upon a time a poor family had a son named Jack. Jack's job was to trade the cows at the market for food and money. One day, he was bringing the cow into town, and he met a mysterious man with a sack in his hand. He told him that the sack conatined magical beans that would grow into a giant beanstalk. Jack, being stupid, agreed to sell his cow for the beans. He brought the beans home, but they were cold, so he heated them up in the microwave. After 30 seconds, he realized the beans were gone. What jack didn't know, is that the microwave had absorbed them, sucking in their nutritious power. This microwave then became a time traveler who wandered all of time to get the most powerful weapons. After collecting a dinosaur that would help him take over the world, he knew nothing could stop him, or could it? Little did Mr. Microwave know, there was a bean that wasnt microwaved. This bean took the magical hat that Mr Microwave had made, and gained other worldly powers. Could Jimmy Bean stop Mr Microwave?!?!1/11 FIND OUT IN NEXT WEEKS EPISODE."],
