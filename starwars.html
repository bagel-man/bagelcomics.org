<p>Favorite Movies of all time. except for the Last Jedi. ya know tbh last 3 movies get a bad rap. except the last jedi that one deserves it. Force Awakens is a GREAT movie. Next one ruined it. and then Rise of Skywalker had nothing to go off of. its all the Last Jedis fault. Also Rey is not a mary sue all she did was grab a lightsaber and with horrible form may i add. luke used the force to guide him to know the excact spot he needed to shoot proton torpedos, and blew up the death star. Hopefully that changed your veiw on that. Prequels are just great though. Clone wars is a masterpeice</p>
